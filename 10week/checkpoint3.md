App Idea: Lyft for Dogs
Why it needs to exist(what problem does it solve?)

Dogs need to get places too:
To the vet
To the dog park
To the pet sitter
How it solves the problem.

Now pet owners can call transportation from anywhere for their pet to get anywhere!
Professionally trained people will be handling your pet in their car, making sure they get to their destination safely
What the app is and how it works

Pet owners use it just like Lyft, but instead of them getting picked up it's their dog
It will show the GPS coordinates of their dog and instructions on how to get their dog
Show the class your first few pages of the web app.

I'd like to try to use ReactJS
I might need a database but I don't know anything about that yet
I might use a Maps API like MapBox.io
