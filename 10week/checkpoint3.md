App Idea: Virtual ETT Goggles

Why it needs to exist(what problem does it solve?)<br>
    - Manual ETT Goggles are expensive and not manufactured well<br>
    - Virtual ETT Goggles will provide remote accessibility<br>
    - Virtual ETT Goggles may allow for further advancement in therapy technology<br>
<br>
How does it solve the problem?<br>
    - Virtual ETT Goggles will provide the client the ability to download the app and receive instruction over the phone while experiencing the therapy at the same time. Currently the only option is to receive the therapy in person.<br>
    - Virtual ETT Goggles may also provide the possibility to advance the therapy by offering different color and/or a flicker option.<br>
<br>
What is the app?<br>
    - ETT - Emotional Transformation Therapy<br>
    - ETT Goggles work in a way that enables the brain to provide pathways of impulses a different routes.<br>
    - This is caused by allowing light to enter the pupil in a specific way.<br>
    - The app will provide the Operator to send specific signals of light to the Client.<br>
<br>
How does it work?<br>
    - Operator View<br>
        ~ The operator will be able to sign in and then connect to the Client.<br>
        ~ The operator will then be able to send signal through the app to appear on the Client's view.<br>
    - Client View<br>
        ~ The client will only be able to download and view the signals being sent by the operator.<br>
<br>
What technologies will you use<br>
    - I have zero idea at this point<br>
    - I am guessing React?<br>
<br>
What questions do YOU have about your app?<br>
    - Is this idea possible and what resources I would need to accomplish it?<br>
